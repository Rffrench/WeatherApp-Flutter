# WeatherApp using Flutter
This is a personal project I have created which is a Weather app using Dart &amp; Flutter and the OpenWeather API. It technically has only 2 screens and 1 modal sheet. 

The first is a Loading Screen with a Spinner and the other one is the main screen which displays the weather and more information: a 7 days forecast, the date, the location, max and min temperatures and an icon representing the weather condition. 
In this screen you also have 2 buttons: one to display the current location weather if for example you are moving or you previously checked a different location and the other button for searching a new location. The latter will open a kind of fixed popup where you can type any location you want and my app will display you the weather forecast for it :) 

Whether you search for a new location or you press the button for the current weather a spinner will become visible in the screen you are currently at.

You can clone it if you want! If you are going to do something else with it at least message me please ;)
